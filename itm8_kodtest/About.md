## Tell me about your system

This system is a lightweight version to access a small number of predefined cities different temperatures using SMHI opendata api.
It is all hardcoded so there is nothing that can be altered, without writing in the code.

## Reflections
It was a fun project to do, I would have liked to have the cities in a database instead of hardcoding it. But that would have taken far too long to set up. 
I would have also liked to do the frontend part of the test, however I felt that the four hour timelimit would have passed way before me being done with it. 
However I had a few fun ideas when playing with the thought of doing it, that I will do in my freetime.
In a perfect world this would have been deployed so that there is no IDE necessary to view it, but my inexperience when doing it outside of my work environment held me back.
