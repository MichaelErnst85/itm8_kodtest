## Instructions on how you run the system
Start the API (itm8_kodtest) so that you can access it from the application (itm8_kodtest_console). If you should start the application before the API is ready, there should be an error message in the console window. 
Logs for API calls are found in bin/Debug/net8.0/logs, these logs print all levels from Information and above.
## Prerequisites
You will need an IDE(Visual Studio 2022) to start the solution for the API, and for the best experience it should also be used for the console application.
